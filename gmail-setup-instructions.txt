## Alternative: Use Less Secure Apps (if App Passwords doesn't work)

If you can't find App Passwords, try:

1. Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
2. Turn **ON** "Allow less secure apps"
3. Use your regular Gmail password instead of App Password

**Note:** This is less secure but may work for testing.

## Troubleshooting

### If App Passwords section is missing:
- Make sure 2-Step Verification is enabled
- Try accessing from a different browser
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Try the direct link: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

### If you see "This setting is not available for your account":
- Your account may have different security settings
- Try the "Less secure apps" option above
- Consider using a different email service
